Managers
========

Managers are simple tasks to be executed on a git repository. Their behaviour is
dependent on the repositories source code, issues and pull requests or even the
contents of a webhook.

Available Managers

    :maxdepth: 1

Developing your own manager
---------------------------

If you would like to develop your own manager, just derive from ``ManagerBase``
class and implement ``run()`` method. This method accepts kwargs that are
directly passed from configuration file (see ``configuration`` section of a
configuration file):

.. code-block:: python

  class UpdateManager(ManagerBase):
      def run(self, labels: list):
          issue = self.get_issue_by_title("Hello from my Kebechet manager")
          if issue is None:
            self.project.create_issue(
              title="Hello from my Kebechet manager",
              body="This is an awesome issue sent automatically from Kebechet manager.",
              labels=labels
            )

If you wish to operate on repository source code, you can request to clone it:

.. code-block:: python

        from kebechet.utils import cloned_repo

        with cloned_repo(self.service_url, self.slug, branch="my_branch") as repo:
            with open('my_file.txt', 'w') as my_file:
                my_file.write("Hello, Kebechet!")

            repo.git.add(my_file)
            repo.git.push()

The last thing you need to do, is to register your manager to
``REGISTERED_MANAGERS`` constant (you can find it in
``kebechet/managers/__init__.py`` file) so that the mapping can be used for
configuration. Best practice is to remove the Manager suffix from the class
name, convert to lowercase and put "-" between each word.

Overlays
--------

Thoth allows users to specify overlays consisting of different runtime
environments.  These runtime environments are specified in a users .thoth.yaml
file, files associated with a specific runtime environment are located in
``<overlays-dir>/<runtime-environment-name>``.  If you create a manager which
acts on individual runtime environments, then the desired behaviour is as
follows.

- if no overlays directory is specified in .thoth.yaml and no
  runtime_environment is passed, then the manager should act only on the first
  entry in `environments` in .thoth.yaml and changes should be made to the top
  level directory.

- if an overlays directory is specified in .thoth.yaml and no
  runtime_environment is passed the manager should act on every runtime
  environment and make changes to the corresponding subdirectory.

- if no overlays directory is specified in .thoth.yaml and a runtime_environment
  is specified then the manager should run on the specified runtime environment
  and overwrite files in the top level regardless of the runtime environment
  used to generate them.

- if an overlays directory is specified in .thoth.yaml and a runtime_environment
  is also specified then the manager should run on the specified runtime
  environment and make the changes to the corresponding subdirectory.

Kebechet works as a part of Thoth Ecosystem, please raise an issue or add the
new manager to the `KebechetGithubAppInstallations
<https://github.com/thoth-station/storages/blob/15ed39ef6c8d7bf58037046f3bab2465c5c4bb22/thoth/storages/graph/models.py#L1434>`_
table.


Configure different managers per Overlays
-----------------------------------------

- Add allow and disallow to each manager's configuration options, where the user can specify which manager is (dis)allowed for each overlay.

Example: .thoth.yaml

.. code-block:: yaml

        host: khemenu.thoth-station.ninja

            version: "8"
            python_version: "3.8"
            recommendation_type: latest

          - name: ps-nlp-pytorch

        managers:
          - name: thoth-advise
            # Do not run this manager in the ps-nlp-tensorflow-gpu overlay
            env_disallow_list:
              - ps-nlp-tensorflow-gpu
            configuration:
              labels: [bot]
          - name: update
            # Run this manager in the ps-nlp-tensorflow-gpu overlay (only)
            env_allow_list:

            configuration:
              labels: [bot]
          - name: info
          # No allow/disallow present: this manager applies to all runtimes
